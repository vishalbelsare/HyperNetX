This page provides additionally documentation for various contributions to HyperNetX through modules.
We use the term module to describe an advanced method for studying hypergraphs. 
Each module includes a descriptive document here as well as a notebook showcasing its functionality.
Tutorial notebooks can be found for each module under the `advanced tutorials  <https://github.com/pnnl/HyperNetX/tree/master/tutorials/advanced>`_ folder in GitHub.
