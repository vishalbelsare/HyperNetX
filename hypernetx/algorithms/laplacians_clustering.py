Hypergraph Probability Transition Matrices, Laplacians, and Clustering
======================================================================
We contruct hypergraph random walks utilizing optional "edge-dependent vertex weights", which are
weights associated with each vertex-hyperedge pair (i.e. cell weights on the incidence matrix).
The probability transition matrix of this random walk is used to construct a normalized Laplacian
matrix for the hypergraph. That normalized Laplacian then serves as the input for a spectral clustering
algorithm. This spectral clustering algorithm, as well as the normalized Laplacian and other details of
this methodology are described in

def prob_trans(H, weights=False, index=True, check_connected=True):
    r"""
    The probability transition matrix of a random walk on the vertices of a hypergraph.
    At each step in the walk, the next vertex is chosen by:

    1. Selecting a hyperedge e containing the vertex with probability proportional to w(e)
    2. Selecting a vertex v within e with probability proportional to a \gamma(v,e)

    If weights are not specified, then all weights are uniform and the walk is equivalent
    to a simple random walk.
    If weights are specified, the hyperedge weights w(e) are determined from the weights
    \gamma(v,e).


    Parameters
    ----------
    H : hnx.Hypergraph
        The hypergraph must be connected, meaning there is a path linking any two
        vertices
    weights : bool, optional, default : False
         Use the cell_weights associated with the hypergraph
         If False, uniform weights are utilized.
    index : bool, optional
        Whether to return matrix index to vertex label mapping
